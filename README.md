# **Churn Rates and Root Causes**

##**Background**

Churn analysis is a process used by businesses to understand and manage customer attrition, or "churn".  Churn analysis helps to identify pain points throughout the customer journey.  It involves examining why customers stop using a product or service and identifying patterns or factors that contribute to their decision to leave.  Understanding those pain points then opens avenues to improve products, services and communication.

This project aims to analyze customer churn rates and identify the underlying causes.


##**Data Description**

The data used in this project includes:
The dataset contains 7043 rows and 21 columns.
Customer transaction history:  Contains information on customer purchases, interactions, and service usage
Customer demographics:  Includes detaisl such as age, gender, marital status, 


The data files are located in the 'data/' directory.


##Methodology

1. Data Collection:  Collect and preprocess data.
2. Churn Rate Calculation:  Compute churn rates using historical data.
3. Root Cause Analysis:  Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to identify factors contributing to churn.
4. Predictive Modeling:  Develop a model to predict customer churn.

For detailed information on each method, reference the notebooks in the 'notebooks/' directory.

##Results

The results section includes:

- Churn Rate Analysis:  Summary of churn rates and trends.
- Root Cause Insights:  Key factors contributing to churn.
- Segmentation Outcomes:  Customer segments at high risk of churn.
- Predictive Model Performance:  Metrics and evaluation of churn prediction model

##**Describing Data**
